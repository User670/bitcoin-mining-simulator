# Short term goals

## Phase 1/4 Multi processing with synchronization

### Part 0 - C language warm up
- [X] Copy over the SHA and header format related code
- [X] Have a functional target check, and a functional brute force loop
- [ ] Current issue: is this enough of a warm up for this task?

### Part 1 - Basic multi processing
- [ ] Parent: create multiple BitCoin headers for the threads to crack
- [ ] Parent: fork
- [ ] Child: brute force and print result

### Part 2 - Synchronization
- [ ] Challenge: What way should we use to inform other processes when a process finds a result?
