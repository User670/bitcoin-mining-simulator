Quick paragragh addressing the various `src` folders

- `src4` is the current working folder.
- `src` is the original source code folder. It's never been touched since I started part 04.
- `src4_copy` is a copy of the `src4` folder before I work on BitcoinBlockv3.
- `src4_20230408` is a copy of the `src4` folder after I do quite a bit on BitcoinBlockv3. It still has the `v3` suffix to the struct/type and many functions - this suffix is being removed in the `src4` folder.
