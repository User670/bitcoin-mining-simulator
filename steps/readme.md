In each sub-folder of this folder, there are these sub-sub-folders:

- `complete` - these contain source code directly copied from my working directory at various points in time. They contain all the comments I made, and potentially leftover debug code, or code from previous parts.
- `cleanup` - these contain code that I cleaned up afterwards. Comments that help understand the code are kept, but random notes, commented-out code, etc. are removed.
- `task` - my attempt at digging holes for students to fill.

Also, my attempts at writing a task prompt are in `task.md`.
