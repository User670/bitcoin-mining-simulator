Update:

`old` had really old and outdated stuff.

`full` has a full copy of the thing. It's also the solution to everything; just change corresponding source file to `main.c`. (Might go and do that myself. Especially because all the temporary/outdated/testing stuff.)

Other folders contain files for students. For parts 00, 01alt, 02, 02Q2, a template is given; for parts 03 and 04, students work off their code from the previous assignment, though instructor may provide the previous assignment's solution as a template on student's request, if the student did poorly or did not finish on the previous part.

A set of instructions are also given in `readme.md` files. (For parts 03 and 04, the readme is the only thing in the folder.)
